function [ ker_val ] = getKernel( x1, x2, lambda, type)
% This function calculates the kernel function at the given points
%
%   Inputs ----------------------------------------------------------------
%   o x1     :  D x 1 vector x_i
%   o x2     :  D x 1 vector x_j
%   o lambda :  Inverse kernel width ( 1/*2*sigma*sigma )
%   o type   :  Kernel type. 'rbf' or 'poly'
%
%   Outputs ---------------------------------------------------------------
%   o ker_val :  Scalar output value
